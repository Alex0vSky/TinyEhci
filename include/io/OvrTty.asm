; TODO(alex): I donâ€™t quite like the branching now,
; for example, you need an include file that will select the "char" output method based on the config
; and another file that selects the set of available output functions
; and the hex dumper will connect the "char" output based on the config, the output functions will be chosen by itself

; Functions using the "PrintChar" implementation
